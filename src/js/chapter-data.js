            We zoomed into water, which is H2O. We also looked at salt which is NaCl. I think when we mix salt and water, we Na and Cl are separated by H and O and that causes salt to dissolve.

            I want to Google to see what happens when we heat up salt and water.

    I made the image below, as a joke, but I think it can help you remember the definition of Sieving. At the risk of making the joke unfunny, here is the meaning of the image below: 

    _When a goalkeeper prevents a goal, we call it a good Save. That sounds a lot like the word Sieve. So this goalkeeper below, uses Sieves to separate footballs from nets._`,

    ![leaf venation](/learning-items/venation2.jpeg)

    Now __Parallel Venation__ is easy to understand. It happens when the pattern created by the veins is parallel to each other. This happens in coconut and banana leaves.

    Let us think about __Reticulate Venation__.

    Reticulate just means a pattern or design that looks like a network or net. We can find these patterns in Giraffes, Leaves and Pythons.

    1) In some scales, the ends may be broken. You may not be able to see the zero mark clearly. In such cases, you should avoid taking measurements from the zero mark of the scale. You can begin from any other full mark, like 1 cm.

    In this experiment a large amount of current is applied to graphite within the pencil. This current is equal to about 25 cells working together.

    Graphite is a good conductor of electricity, so it lets current flow through it. Since we are applying a lot of current, the pencil starts to burn, and very soon the graphite begins to glow. In the end, the electric current applied is so strong that it breaks the graphite.

              Yes, I have seen this happen. Not just with water, but with all other cold drinks also. I think this is because of condensation.

              There is water vapour in the air around the bottle. The bottle is cold. That cold bottle cools the water vapour, which condenses back into tiny water droplets. We see these water droplets outside the bottle.`

    I use the image on the cover of this book to remember the meaning of Alimentary Canal.

    Alimentary Canal is path along which the food passes in our body. It includes the mouth, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus.

       - The silkworms eat mulberry leaves for about 25-30 days.
       - Silkworm begin to secrete a fibre and covers itself in that fibre. This covering is called a cocoon.
       - The silkworm inside the cocoon develops into a silk moth (or flying insect).
       - To obtain silk, the cocoons are boiled. This kills the silkworm inside and prevents it from turning into a moth and coming out of the cocoon.
       -  Silk fibres from cocoons are removed and then spun together to make silk thread.

    title: 'Why are Cocoons Boiled?',
    instructions: dedent`
      A few weeks after the caterpillar has spun a cocoon, it develops into a silk moth (or a flying insect). They emerge from the cocoon by braking the cocoon and the silk thread.

      To prevent the moth from breaking the delicate thread, the cocoons are boiled. This kills the moth inside. The undamaged silk thread can then be removed from the cocoon.

      The video below shows what would happen if the cocoons were __not__ boiled — in that case the silk moth would emerge from the cocoon. This video running in fast forward mode. It shows 16 minutes of recorded video tape in 4 minutes.

      It can be hard to understand the difference between conduction and convection. This video explains the difference clearly.

      We begin by talking about something called _Heat Transfer_.

      If we heat a pot on a stove, the heat will move from the bottom of the pot to the handles of the pot. This is heat transfer. Heat transfer means that heat flows from a body with higher temperature to a body with lower temperature.

      Both Conduction and Convection are types of heat transfer.

      Conduction is heat transfer in solids (example when heating a pot).

      Convection is heat transfer in liquids and gases (example when heating water).

    Earlier in this chapter, we saw that heat transfer in a liquid or gas is called __Convection__. One example of convection is the breeze (or wind) that blows in coastal areas.

    During the day, air above land gets heated faster than the air over sea. And hot air rises — we have seen this in hot air balloons. When the hot air above land expands and rises, the cool air from the sea, takes its place. This is called __sea breeze__.

    In this example, transfer of heat is happening through air, and air is a gas. Thus, this is an example of convection. 

    At night the reverse process happens. 

    During night time, water cools down more slowly than land. Thus the air above water expands and rises. When this happens the air from land moves in to take its place. This is called __land breeze__.

    Water in a heater transfers heat due to __Convection.__

    The flame or source of heat in a water heater is at the bottom of the heater. 

    The water at the bottom of the heater gets heated first and rises up; and the cold water from the top of the heater sinks to the bottom.

    In this example, the heat is transferring through water, which is a liquid. Thus the process responsible for heat transfer is Convection.

    Now engineers take advantage of this process. If we look inside a heater, we will find that the pipe used to take water away from this heater and to our taps is located at the top of the heater. This is because all of the hot water in the heater rises to the top.

    Also new, cold water is added to the heater from the bottom of the heater. This is done so the cold water does not mix with the hot water at the top.

    On page 43, our science books says this: _“From the sun, the heat comes to us by another process known as radiation.”_ Let us think about this sentence.
    
    ![sun heat radiation science book](/learning-items/grade7/class7-science-book-radiation.jpeg)

    The heat we receive from the sun is due to radiation. Here is why the heat from the sun is __not__ due to conduction or convection.

    Conduction is heat transfer in solids, like heating pots or pans in the kitchen. And convection is heat transfer in gases or liquids, like boiling water. 

    Radiation does not need a medium like solids, liquids or gases. It can take place in the _presence or absence_ of a medium.

    For example the heat from the sun travels to the earth through space (which is empty, and not a medium) and then just before it reaches the earth it goes through the atmosphere (which is a gas, and definitely a medium).

    Heat transfer from radiation can happen with or without a medium.
    
    ![sun heat radiation](/learning-items/grade7/sun-heat-radiation.jpeg)

    Oh and one more thing. We know that sun can transfer heat through radiation. But Sun is not alone in that group. Everything that has some temperature radiates. 

    You radiate; the sun radiates; the light bulb radiates; your phone, cat and dog also radiate.

    Things with greater temperature generally radiate more.

    When we sit in front of a fire, we feel warm. That is due to __radiation__. 

    When I said this in a class, one student asked, _"why is heat from fire not conduction or convection?"_ Let us think about this together.

    If we were to stick a metal rod in the fire, the fire would heat the rod, and the rod would burn our hand. Since the rod is solid, the process here is __conduction__.

    If we put our hand above the fire, we would feel the hot air rising. Since air is a gas, heat transfer through air is __convection__. 

    Now this fire will also heat the air around it (in addition to the hot air rising from the fire). And we may feel a bit of that warm air. The process responsible here is also __convection__.

    Finally, imagine that the air around the fire is really cool or that a cool wind is blowing around the fire. Even then, we will still experience heat from the fire. This heat transfer is because of __radiation__. 

    Everything that has some temperature transfers heat through radiation.

    A clinical thermometer is used to measure the temperature of our body. Doctors use it in their clinics and we use it in our homes.

    This thermometer can measure a range of temperatures: from 35°C to 42°C. The normal temperature of the human body is around 37°C. 

    By the way, when we read 37°C, we say 37 degree Celcius. 

    Above 42°C, death can occur. Below 35°C, we can experience intense shivering, loss of movement in fingers, slowing down of heart, and death.

    There is a bulb in the front of the thermometer; it stores mercury. Mercury is very sensitive to temperature change. So if the temperature of our body changes even slightly, the mercury inside the thermometer moves, and we can tell the correct temperature.

    But mercury is poisonous. Exposure to mercury can cause memory loss, trouble speaking or hearing and even death. Therefore new, digital thermometers do not use mercury.

    ![clinical thermometer temperature range](/learning-items/grade7/clinical-thermometer.jpeg)

    Also, there is a kink near the bulb of the clinical thermometer. 

    This kink stops mercury from falling back into the bulb of the thermometer immediately after measuring the body temperature. This gives us enough time to take the thermometer out of our mouth, so we can read the temperature.

        To read the correct temperature, begin by counting the total number of divisions between 36°C to 37°C. There are 10 of them. 

        The first division is 36.1°C; the second is 36.2°C; the third division is 36.3°C and so on. Thus, the correct answer is 36.7°C.

        Here is a way to think about this: The total space between 36°C and 37°C represents 1 degree. And there are a total of 10 divisions between 36°C and 37°C. So each small division represents 1/10 = 0.1 degree. Thus the first division is 36.1°C, the second is 36.2°C, the third division is 36.3°C and so on.

    A lab thermometer is used in a laboratory to measure temperature. For example it is used to measure the temperature of hot water.

    This thermometer can measure a range of temperatures. From -10°C to 110°C.

    Also, a laboratory thermometer does not have a kink near its bulb. You may recall that a clinical thermometer has a kink near its bulb.

            The first difference is in the size. The lab thermometer is much bigger than the clinical thermometer. 

            The lab thermometer can also measure temperatures from -10°C to 110°C. But the clinical thermometer measures temperature only from 35°C to 42°C.

            Finally, there is a kink near the bulb of a clinical thermometer, but no kink is present in a laboratory thermometer. 

            The kink prevents the mercury from falling back into the bulb of the clinical thermometer immediately. This gives us enough time to take the thermometer out of our mouth, so we can read the temperature. 

            But if we measure the temperature of hot water with a lab thermometer, we have to do so while keeping the thermometer in the water. Otherwise the mercury begins to fall as soon as we take the lab thermometer out of the water.

    One is Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), another is Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) and the third is sugar solution. But these liquids are not labelled, so you do not know which is which.

    You only have turmeric indicator. How will you identify the 3 liquids?

            I will add the the turmeric solution to each of the 3 liquids.

            I know that turmeric will turn a base red. So the liquid that turns red is Sodium Hydroxide.

            Then we are left with HCl and sugar solution, but we still do not know which is which.

            So I will add Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) to both solutions. The one where neutralisation reaction occurs to produce heat, salt and water is an acid i.e. HCl.

            The remaining solution is sugar solution.

   The first part of the word _antacid_ reminds me of other words like _anticlockwise_ and _antibacterial_.

   The word _anti_ is used in front of other words to reverse their meaning.

   Thus, when I think of the word antacid, I think of anti-acid, or a base.

   Our stomach contains an acid called HCl. Excess of that acid can cause stomach problems. To reverse or neutralise the effect of too much acid, we drink a base in the form of an antacid like Eno.`,

    Any change to the _shape, size, colour or state_ of a substance is called a physical change.

    __Changing Shape:__ Cutting a piece of paper is a physical change.

    __Changing Colour:__ Heating an iron rod until it is red hot is a physical change.

    __Changing State:__ Boiling water is a physical change.

    Burning a matchstick is a chemical change, because new substances like heat and light are produced as a result of lighting a match.

            Oxygen is present everywhere.

            In coastal areas, air has more moisture (or water) because of the nearby sea.

            The water from the sea evaporates and is present as moisture in the air. The air in deserts, however, is dry because there is no water body close by.

            Since more moisture is available in the air in coastal areas, iron objects like ships and iron doors rust faster.

            I can think of several changes that happen when a candle burns.

            When the wax melts, it just changes from solid to liquid, which is a physical change.

            When the wax burns, it is used to produce heat and light. Since a new substance is produced in this process, it is a chemical change.

            Finally, when we cook food we see both physical and chemical changes. For example, when we cook vegetables that is a chemical change; and when we boil water that is a physical change. Also, when we roll the dough to make chapatis, that is a physical change. And finally when we put those chapatis on a tava or pan to bake them, that is a chemical change.

      In this video, a teacher adds a blue powder (copper sulphate powder) into a blue solution (copper sulphate solution). He keeps adding the powder until the powder does not dissolve in the solution any more.

      He then suspends a thread in that solution. After a few days, he takes out large crystals of copper sulphate from the solution.

      The process of obtaining large crystals of pure substances from their solution is called Cyrstallisation.

      Now, if you are confused and wondering why we are studying this stuff, I must say that I am confused too. I actually am not sure why the authors of the science book put cyrstallisation into this chapter.

    When the wind changes the shape of a rock, it also erodes or breaks down parts of the rock. These eroded particles are further broken down by wind to form soil.

    The process by which rocks are broken down into soil by wind (and water and other climate factors) is called Weathering.

    __Clayey Soil__: We know that Clayey soil has small particles. These small particles are packed really tightly with each other. Thus there are only small empty spaces left in between those particles.

    Small empty spaces leaves very little space for air. Thus Clayey soil does not have a lot of air. Also, water can easily be held in between these small empty spaces. Thus Clayey soil can hold a lot of water.

    __Sandy Soil__: We know that Sandy soil has large particles. These large particles do not fit closely and cannot be packed really tightly. Thus there are large empty spaces in between those particles.

    Large empty spaces leaves a lot of space for air. That means that Sandy soil has a lot of air or is well aerated. Also, water can easily leak through these large empty spaces. Thus Sandy soil does not hold a lot of water and is dry.

    _Activity 9.4 on Page 100_ of your science book, lists the following steps.

    __Step 1__: Imagine you have an empty pipe, and you make the pipe stand in some soil.
    ![percolation rate empty pipe](/learning-items/grade7/percolation-rate-empty-pipe.jpeg)

    __Step 2__: Then you pour water into that empty pipe from a 200 milliliter bottle. You also start the  timer when you begin pouring.
    ![percolation rate pour water](/learning-items/grade7/percolation-rate-pour-water.jpeg)

    __Step 3__: The water will start percolating through the soil or passing through the soil. Wait till __all__ the water has percolated.
    ![percolation rate water leaks](/learning-items/grade7/percolation-rate-water-leaks.jpeg)

    __Step 4__: When all the water has passed through the soil, and the pipe is completely empty, stop the timer. Let us say that the time taken was 20 minutes. We can use this experiment to calculate the __Percolation Rate__.
    ![percolation rate stop watch](/learning-items/grade7/percolation-rate-stop-watch.jpeg)

    Now to understand Percolation Rate, let us first  think of Over Rate in cricket.
    ![over rate cricket](/learning-items/grade7/over-rate-cricket.jpeg)

    Over Rate is the speed with which a team bowls their overs.

    It is calculated by dividing the number of overs bowled by the time taken to bowl those overs. So if 30 overs were bowled in 3 hours, the over rate is 10 overs per hour.
    ![over rate example](/learning-items/grade7/overrate-example.jpeg)

    Similarly, __Percolation Rate__ is the speed with which water can pass through the soil.

    It is calculated by dividing the amount of water poured in soil by the time it took to percolate. So if it takes 200 mL of water 20 minutes to pass through soil, the percolation rate is 10 mL/min.

    Sand has large particles. These large particles are NOT packed tightly against each other, and thus there are large spaces between these particles. Water can easily leak or percolate in between these large spaces.

    But Clay and Loam do not have large particles and thus they can hold water better than Sand.

    In this activity we will take equal amounts of 3 soil samples — Clay, Loam and Sand. We then pour a similar amount of water through each of them.

    __Clayey Soil__: We find that only a little bit of the water passes through clay. That tells us that clay absorbs a lot of water.

    Clayey soil has small particles; and small particles have small spaces between them. Those small spaces allow only a little bit of water to pass through. Thus clay absorbs or retains a lot of  water.

    __Sandy Soil__: We also find that most of the water passes through sand. That tells us that sand absorbs very little water.

    Sand has big particles; and big particles have big spaces between them. Those big spaces allow almost all of the water to pass through. Thus sand absorbs or retains a very small amount of water.

    __Loamy Soil__: Loamy soil is a mixture of sand and clay. Thus, loamy soil absorbs more water than sand but less water than clay.

            When we run, our body needs more energy than when we do during other tasks like sleeping.

            To get energy, the cells in our body need to convert glucose into energy. To do that our cells need oxygen.

            Now since the cells need more energy, they need to convert more glucose into energy, and thus the cells need more oxygen.

            Since oxygen is part of the air, the athlete breathes faster and deeper after running to take in more oxygen into their body.

    When we run or do heavy exercise, our muscles need a lot of energy. Thus we breathe fast so we can take in more oxygen to convert more glucose into energy.

    But even with breathing fast, the supply of oxygen is limited.

    So muscles convert glucose into energy _without oxygen_ to fulfill the demand for additional energy; this process, as you know, is called anaerobic respiration.

    In muscles, this process also produces something called lactic acid.

    Lactic acid is poisonous and can cause muscles to stop working. This is why we feel a burning sensation or soreness in our muscles during heavy exercise.

    So we know that we breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide.

    Actually, that is not completely correct.

    __Breathing In__: When we breathe in air, we breathe in all gases that make up the air. Oxygen is 21% of air. So 21% of every breath we inhale is oxygen. And only 0.04% of air is carbon dioxide. So 0.04% of every breath we take in is carbon dioxide.

    __Breathing Out__: When we exhale, we breathe out a mixture of gases. 4 to 6% of the air we exhale is carbon dioxide. And 16% of the air we exhale is oxygen. We use some of the oxygen we inhaled, and the rest we simply breathe out.`,

    The science book say something on _page 133_ that is hard to remember.

    It says that __leaves, roots and stems__ are the _vegetative parts of a plant_.

    It also says that the __flower__ is the _reproductive part of a plant_.

    Here is one easy way to remember this. Think of vegetables like spinach and carrots.

    Spinach consists of leaves and carrot is a root. When we eat vegetables like spinach (leaves), and carrots (root), we are eating the vegetative parts of the plant.

    ![vegetative parts plant leaves roots stem](/learning-items/grade7/vegetative-parts-plant-leaves-roots-stems.jpeg)

    And then I hope the GIF below gets stuck in your head and helps you remember that the flower is the reproductive part of the plant.

    We know that vegetative parts of plant include leaves, roots and stems.

    And one meaning of the word _propagation_ is to reproduce.

    So vegetative propagation is the reproduction of plants from vegetative parts like leaves, roots and stems. Examples include rose (from stem) and bryophyllum (from leaves).

    Also, since no seeds are involved here, vegetative propagation is categorized as asexual reproduction.

      If we mix a pinch of this yeast in water with some sugar, and see it under the microscope, we will find something similar to this video below.

      A small bulb-like project comes out of yeast cell; this is called a bud. It then gets detached from the parent and forms a new cell. This process is called __budding__.

      Notice how no seeds are involved in this form of reproduction. Thus it is a form of Asexual Reproduction. By now, we have come across 3 different types of Asexual Reproduction:
       - Vegetative Propagation (rose, bryophyllum)

    Let us start this section by looking at pollination.

    Pollen from the male part of one flower (anther) travels to the female part of another flower (stigma) by sticking on animals like bees. This process is called __pollination__.

    ![pollination stamen pistil pollen anther](/learning-items/grade7/pollination-pollen-anther-stamen.jpeg)

    Once the pollen lands on stigma, the contents of pollen move from the stigma to the style and then into the ovules.

    Remember, the contents of pollen are in the __ovules__ now.
    ![pollen moves from stigma to style to ovules](/learning-items/grade7/pollen-moves-stigma-style-ovary2.jpeg)

    Let us start with the first two words: __Gametes and Zygote__.

    Now we have seen thus far that the contents of pollen have moved to the ovules.

    Pollen has some cells called __Male Gametes__. Ovules have some cells called __Female Gametes__.

    Gametes means cells that can combine with others to reproduce.

    So when male gametes from pollen and female gametes from ovules combine, they have the ability to reproduce and create a new organism.

    The result is called a Zygote, which is just a fused cell. Or a joined cell.

    This process, by the way, is called __fertilisation__.
    ![fertilisation male gametes female gametes zygote](/learning-items/grade7/fertilisation-male-gamete-female-gamete-zygote2.jpeg)

    The zygote grows into something called an __Embryo__.

    An embryo is an important part of the new seed and can be thought of as a young, developing plant.

    This new seed will help to make new plants in the future.
    ![zygote embryo seed](/learning-items/grade7/zygote-embryo-seed2.jpeg)

    So we have seen that the contents of pollen move into the ovules. This leads to fertilisation.

    And then the Ovules in the flower turn into seeds. Also, the Ovary in the flower turns into the fleshy part of the fruit that surrounds the seed.
   ![ovules seeds ovary fruit](/learning-items/grade7/ovules-seed-ovary-fruit.jpeg)

    This is how flowers turn into fruits with seeds.

    The fruit can now be eaten by animals in the forest, who will then drop the seeds somewhere, and if enough sunlight, soil and water are available, that seed will grow into a new plant.

    This process of plant reproduction through seeds is known as __Sexual Reproduction__.

            Flowers have a male part called Stamen. Stamen has anther, which also has pollen(sneeze).

            Flowers also have a female part called Pistil. Pistil has stigma, style, ovary and ovules.

            Ok, so when a bee comes to a flower, the pollen sticks to it. When it goes to another flower of the same type, it transfers the pollen on to that flower.

            Now the cells inside pollen move from stigma to style and then to the ovules.

            Then the male reproductive cells (or male gametes) from the pollen combine with the female reproductive cells (or female gametes) in the Ovule. This is called fertilisation and produces and joint cell called zygote.

            This cell can grow to form a seed. An important part of the seed is an embryo.

    More specifically, here is what happens:
     - Ovules turn to seeds
     - Ovary turns to fruit

    instructions: dedent`
      Once a seed has been formed by the plant, the seed can grow into a new plant.

      To have the best chance of growing into a new plant, the seed needs to be far away from the parent. If the seed were to grow right next to the parent, there would be a lot of competition for sunlight and water between the parent and the seed.

      Thus plants benefit from seed dispersal. That simply means movement of seed far away from the parent.

      This can happen in a few ways:
       - by wind
       - by animals
       - by water

    Veins carry blood filled with carbon dioxide and other waste products from the body back to the heart.

    It is important that this blood flow only in the direction towards the heart, and not away from it.

    Thus veins have valves. A valve is a flap that allows a fluid like blood to flow in one direction.

    Muscles around veins squeeze to push the blood towards the heart. Once the blood has moved through a section of the vein, the valve closes which prevents that blood from flowing backwards.

      If you watch this video till the end, you will see a huge steel drum get crushed. Clearly, some force is crushing the drum. What is it? The answer is the pressure exerted by air from outside the drum. Let us find out how.

      Water was added to a drum and then that water was boiled. This meant that the water in the drum converted to steam and escaped.

      Then the drum was put in ice water. This caused any steam left inside the drum to condense back into water, thus reducing the amount of air inside the drum.

      Now less air inside the drum means that the air pressure inside the drum has decreased. But the air pressure outside the drum continues to be the same as before.

      This difference is air pressure crushes the steel drum.

      When we blow air on top of a piece of paper, the paper rises. Why?

      When we blow air on top of a piece of paper, the air on top is moving faster than the air below the paper.

      Fast moving air creates low pressure. So there is low pressure on top of paper, and high at the bottom. This difference in pressure is what lifts the paper.

    Here is a [great simulation](http://cdac.olabs.edu.in/?sub=74&brch=9&sim=38&cnt=59) for the images produced by a concave mirror. You can move the candle in the simulation to see how the concave mirror behaves.

    __When Standing Really Close To A Concave Mirror__

    In this scenario, the image produced is erect, larger than the object, and also virtual. A virtual image simply means that it cannot be obtained on a screen.
    ![concave mirror standing close image erect virtual magnified](/learning-items/grade7/concave-mirror-erect-virtual-image.jpeg)

    Here is a diagram that shows the image produced by a concave mirror when the object is really close to it. Notice how the candle (the object) is really close to the mirror, and the image of the candle is erect, magnified and virtual.
    ![concave mirror standing close image erect virtual magnified](/learning-items/grade7/concave-mirror-erect-virtual-image-ray-diagram.jpeg)

    __When Standing Far Away From A Concave Mirror__

    In this scenario, the image produced is inverted; that means it is upside down. The image is also real; that means the image can be obtained on a screen.
    ![concave mirror standing far image inverted real](/learning-items/grade7/concave-mirror-image-real-inverted.jpeg)

    Here is a diagram that shows the image produced by a concave mirror when the object is far away from it. Notice how the candle (the object) is far away from the mirror, and the image of the candle is inverted, bigger than the object and real.

    You can play with this [great simulation](http://cdac.olabs.edu.in/?sub=74&brch=9&sim=38&cnt=59) to see the type of images produced by the concave mirror.

    __Salt water__: Oceans make about 97% of all water on earth. Ocean water contains salt and thus is also called salt water. We cannot use salt water for drinking and washing purposes as it contains salt in it. 

    In some places ocean water is purified by removing salt from it; humans can then use this purified water. But this process takes a lot of energy and is expensive.

    __Freshwater__: The remaining 3% of all water on earth is freshwater. It includes water frozen as snow in glaciers, water below the ground, and water in rivers. This water does not have salt in it, and thus we humans can use this water.

    Also, even though water frozen as snow in glaciers does not have salt, it is not available for humans to use because it is frozen. So we can only use the freshwater below the ground and water in rivers and lakes.

    Water on the surface of the earth (example rain water or water in rivers) sometimes seeps through the soil and fills the empty spaces between the cracks of rocks.

    This process of seeping of water into ground is called __Infiltration__.

    The upper limit of the water below ground is called __Water Table__.

        The word __infiltration__ generally means _entering or moving in_. This word is generally used when an army __infiltrates__ into enemy location.

    Aquifer is made up of two words — _aqua_ and _fer_. 

    _Aqua_ means water. 

    And _fer_ means _to carry or bring_.  Like the word _Ferry_, which is a boat that carries or brings passengers.

    Thus aquifer means a place that carries or brings water.

    Here is a map of the major aquifers all around the word. The places in dark blue show where aquifers are located. The major aquifer in India is located where the Ganga flows.

    Water table depletion happens when the level of groundwater goes down. If that happens we will need to dig deeper wells and use more energy to pump water from the ground. 

    There are several reasons for water table depletion. Three of them are:

    Animals can spread tree seeds in a forest, and thus help the forest grow.

    Consider a raccoon, an animal found in the forests of North America. A raccoon eats fruits from a tree including the seeds inside the fruit.

    A few hours later, the raccoon poops out waste, which includes seeds they had previously eaten. These seeds now have a chance to blossom into a new fruit tree.

    Animals like the raccoon can help regenerate forests by dispersing the seeds of trees.`,

            Here are some ways I can think in which animals help grow the forests:

             1) Animals help in seed dispersal. They eat fruits, and when they poop, the seeds are deposited. These seeds can turn into new trees.

             2) Dead bodies of animals are converted to humus after decomposition. This increases the fertility of soil.

             3) Animal poop acts as a fertilizer for the soil in the forest.

    Forests slow down the fall of rain water.

    It can take up to 10 minutes for a falling raindrop to travel from a rainforest\`s thick canopy to the floor of the forest.

    This extra time allows the water that reaches the floor to seep underground before more water gathers. Floods are prevented since forests do not allow the rain water to gather or accumulate.`,

            The first thing we have to think about is the canopy of a forest. It is the overlapping leaves and branches of trees high up in the forest.

            The canopy is thick and it slows down the movement of rainwater.

            Since rainwater takes more time to reach the forest floor, water does not accumulate. In this way, forests prevent floods.

      This fundamental fact of nature has changed our lives. We use this fact to build things like the electric doorbells and really fast trains.

      Let us travel to Japan in this video to see how this works.

      When current flows through a wire, it acts like a magnet.

      In this video a coil of wire is connected to a battery and a compass is placed inside the coil. Before the coil is connected to the battery, the compass points towards the Earths north pole.

      As soon as the coil of wire is connected to the battery, it starts acting like a magnet. The compass feels the influence of this new magnet and thus moves.

            Plastic bags are not magnetic.

            So no, an electromagnet, or any other magnet, will not be able to separate a plastic bag from a heap.

            There are 2 cells that make a battery in this circuit.

            But those cells are not connected properly. The positive ends of the cells are connected together, which is wrong.

            I will turn one of the cells so that the positive end of one cell is connected to the negative end of the other cell. This way electricity will start flowing through the circuit and the bulb will light up.

    We can find a fuse inside an electrical plug.

    Imagine this plug is connected to a toaster. Further imagine if suddenly there is an excessive amount of current flowing through the wires. This current will certainly damage the toaster.

    The fuse can protect the toaster.

    This thin wire melts when too much current flows through it. This means that the circuit is no longer complete and current stops flowing through the toaster.`,

      Appliances like heaters, televisions and air conditioners run on electricity. These appliances can catch fire or be destroyed if a large current is passed through them.

      A fuse can solve this problem.

      A fuse is a metal wire that melts when too much current flows through it. So if a fuse is a part of an electrical circuit, and a large amount of current flows through the circuit, then the fuse will melt.

      Once the fuse melts the circuit is no longer fully connected and thus the flow of current will stop; that will protect the appliance from getting destroyed.

      In this video current is passed through a fuse. The amount of current is then increased. After a point, the fuse becomes red hot and melts.
